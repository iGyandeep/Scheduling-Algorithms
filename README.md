# Scheduling-Algorithms
> A Scheduling Algorithm is the algorithm which tells us how much CPU time we can allocate to the processes.
> Types of Scheduling Algorithms:
    |
    |
    -------> Non-Preemptive Scheduling Algorithm: If the process is started then required resources are provided to the process and all the aquired resources will be free only when the running process is completed.
                                                 >  Example of Non-Preemptive Process:- FCFS, SJF
    |
    |
    -------> Preemprive Scheduling Algorithm: In this, if the process is started it will be interrupted in between the execution and the another process is starts using CPU.
                                                 >  Example of Preemptive Process:- SRTN, Round Robin), Priority Basis, Multi-level Feedback.
